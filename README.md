Due to some unexplained errors in deployment of my project, I have not been able to provide a link to my project.

Please follow the following steps to run my project.

1. Clone the repositery or download the zip file. The files in question are in phase2/model-netflix, please ignore robot folder.
2. Open "terminal" / "cmd" / "gitbash" and change directory to "model-netflix" and run "npm install" to install dependencies.
3. Step 3: Run "npm run start" to run the project.
